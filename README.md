This repository is the **single source of truth** for every media and design file used by **Parres**:

We track big binaries (videos, high-res images, sources) with **Git LFS**.  
 
One-time setup per machine:
```
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```
After that, clone/pull/push as usual—LFS swaps small text pointers ↔ real files automatically.
